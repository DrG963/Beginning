# Beginning
The start


Loops through a query showing top 10 results based off the user input. Displays in table. If the database entry does not have an alias,
the border will be red. If it does have an alias, it will be a green border. Very simple. Press update to change seach. 




*This code uses a datbase define locally, and will not just work for anyone. This is a simple tool built to loop through results
                     and make it easy and visual to know if the entry needs an alias or not. *
